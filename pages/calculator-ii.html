        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>This program interprets every part of a function as one of three things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A numerical value</li>
          <li>A variable</li>
          <li>
            <p>A function. Functions can be either unary (such as logarithms), or binary. There are no
              <span class="math">n</span>-ary
              functions implemented for <span class="math">n > 2</span>; instead, a term such as <span class="math">1 + 2 + 3</span> is
              interpreted
              as two binary functions:
              first, <span class="math">(1 + 2)</span>, then, <span class="math">((1 + 2) + 3)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>For the binary functions, there are five possible operators:
            <ul>
              <li>Addition (+)</li>
              <li>Subtraction (-)</li>
              <li>Multiplication (*)</li>
              <li>Division (/)</li>
              <li>Exponent (^)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This approach to interpreting all possible reasonably-simple math terms makes the program much easier to
          write. </p>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>This program makes good use of a technique similar to structural induction, where all functions are built on
          the same pattern derived from the structure of a single term.</p>
        <p>Any function that get called on the input given by the user is called on the uppermost term. Then, the
          function has only 8 cases to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What happens when the term is a number?</li>
          <li>What happens when the term is a variable?</li>
          <li>What happens when the term is a unary function?</li>
          <li>What happens when the term is a binary function? Behaviour is generally different for each of the five
            operators.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In cases where the term is a unary or binary function, the same code function is called on any parameter
          terms passed to the unary/binary function. Almost all processing of any input works in this pattern: recursion
          on the structure of a mathematical term.</p>
        <h3>Math</h3>
        <p>As can be seen by expanding the "Steps" section above, the algorithm to solve any given equation is as
          follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parse the equation</li>
          <li>Reformat the equation</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Expand exponents</li>
            <li>Apply the distributive property</li>
            <li>Apply the commutative property</li>
            <li>Collect like terms</li>
            <li>Evaluate all numerical values</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Solve the equation</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify the equation type</li>
            <li>Solve the equation according to its type</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Parse the equation</h4>
        <p>The program must first learn to understand the given equation, by breaking it up into the four data types
          listed earlier: values, variables, unary functions, and binary functions. This understandable, 'parsed'
          equation
          is then able to be interpreted by the reformatting and solving steps.</p>
        <p>
          All reformatting steps reformat the equation <span class="math">f(x₁, ..., xₘ) = g(xₘ₊₁, ..., xₙ)</span> by understanding
          it as
          <span class="math">f(x₁, ..., xₘ) - g(xₘ₊₁, ..., xₙ) = 0</span>, then only reformatting the left side, since there is
          nothing to change about the new right side.
        </p>
        <h4>Expand exponents</h4>
        <p>
          To reduce the number of cases the distributive property handler has to understand, all exponents are expanded
          into a series of multiplied terms. For example, <span class="math">(x+2)^2</span> becomes <span class="math">(x+2)(x+2)</span>.
        </p>
        <h4>Apply the distributive property</h4>
        <p>
          The statement is then distributed recursively according to a long list of distribution rules. Some examples
          include
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math">x(y+z) = xy + xz</span></li>
          <li><span class="math">x(y-z) = xy - xz</span></li>
          <li><span class="math">f(x)(y+z) = f(x)y + f(x)z</span></li>
          <li><span class="math">(x*y)/z = x/z + y/z</span></li>
          <li>The list goes on for 40+ unique combinations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The end goal of this is to, where possible, bring the disjunctive operators <span class="math">+</span> and <span class="math">-</span>
          to the top level of the equation. Then, like terms can more easily be collected in later steps, without having
          to repeat the distribution step.</p>
        <h4>Apply the commutative property</h4>
        <p>To allow the program to more easily identify like terms for the collection step, all conjunctive
          terms&mdash;those with values connected by multiplication&mdash;are rearranged such that any variables are on
          the right side of the term, and any values are on the left side of the term. For example, <span class="math">(x * 4)</span>
          becomes <span class="math">(4 * x)</span> </p>
        <h4>Collect like terms</h4>
        <p>All terms that share equal coefficients are collected, reducing the complexity of the evaluation step and
          making the type of equation easier to identify when solving it. </p>
        <p>For example, <span class="math">((4 * x) + (5 * x))</span> becomes <span class="math">((4 + 5) * x)</span>.</p>
        <h4>Evaluate numerical values</h4>
        <p>In this step, the program finally does arithmetic to simplify all numerical values. It also cancels out
          multiplication by zero or one, checks for division by zero or one, and simplifies any addition or subtraction
          by zero.</p>
        <p>For example, <span class="math">((4 + 5) * x)</span> becomes <span class="math">(9 * x)</span>.</p>
        <h4>Identify the equation type</h4>
        <p>The calculator first tries to identify the type of equation before solving it. Special types, such as linear
          diophantine equations, variable-free equations, and quadratic equations can then be filtered into special
          solving patterns. </p>
        <h4>Solve the identified equation</h4>
        <p>The calculator then solves the equation. For specialized types, such as quadratic equations, it applies a
          specialized algorithm to produce an answer, such as the quadratic formula.</p>
        <p>For other types, the algorithm simply isolates the solved-for variable by moving all non-variable terms to
          the right-hand side of the equation. It then evaluates that right-hand side by the evaluation rules from the
          previous evaluation step to produce a final answer. </p>
        <h3>Test-driven development</h3>
        <p>Both unit tests and integration tests are used to build code confidence in this calculator. Each step,
          represented by a JavaScript ES6 class, has its own <code>.test()</code> function that runs through a series of
          inputs and outputs to ensure that the step works correctly. Integrations test also exist at the top layer of
          the program, giving a user-like input to the calculator and checking against an expected answer.</p>
